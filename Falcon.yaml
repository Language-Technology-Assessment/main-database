# availability:
datasources_basemodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb
    notes: From the documentation 'The key ingredient for the high quality of the Falcon models is their training data, predominantly based (>80%) on RefinedWeb — a novel massive web dataset based on CommonCrawl' (https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). However, only a small sample is made available.

datasources_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot
    notes: RL data inherited from Baize but provenance not well-documented. From the documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct was finetuned on a 150M tokens from Baize mixed with 5% of RefinedWeb data.'

weights_basemodel:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct/tree/main
    notes: Model weights available through HuggingFace library

weights_endmodel:
    class: closed
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot#v1
    notes: No RL weights or checkpoints made available

trainingcode:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: No source code shared, even though the term "open source" is used.

# documentation
code:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No source code found, therefore no documentation found.

hardware_architecture:
    class: partial
    link:
    notes: Architecture sketched on HuggingFace as "Falcon-40B-Instruct is a 40B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-40B and finetuned on a mixture of Baize."

        - https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16867
    notes: First preprint covers the creation and curation of RefinedWeb dataset, but not other aspects of the model. The second preprint provides more details about the model architecture, implementation, evaluation results, and limitations.

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: Model card on HuggingFace is mostly used to advertise the model, not to document its training and evaluation details.

datasheet:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116
    notes: The preprint on RefinedWeb dataset presents a datasheet in a section named "RefinedWeb Datasheet", which goes into quite a bit of detail on collection, preprocessing etc.

# access
package:
    class: open
    link: https://ollama.com/library/falcon3
    notes: Model available on Ollama.

api:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: There is no API, and HuggingFace inference API is disabled for this model.

licenses:
    class: open
    link:
    notes: First release came with a legally murky license that was swiftly criticised and now generates a 404. Current documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.'
