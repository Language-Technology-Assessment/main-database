    notes: repository provides 'minimal code to run our 7B model'

# documentation:

    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference/tree/main/src/mistral_inference
    notes: repository contains minimal code to run the models; also open source code, althought it is mostly uncommented and not documented very well.

    notes: Some information on architecture provided in github repo

preprint:
    class: partial
