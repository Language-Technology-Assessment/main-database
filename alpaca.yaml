    notes: Based on LLaMA, whose pretraining data is nowhere disclosed or documented.

datasources_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release
    notes: alpaca_data.json contains 52K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model.
