    notes: Training data not centrally made available, but described in 2022 ACL paper, appears to be mostly public datasets. Preprint also mentions "Our pre-training corpus consists of multilingual (mostly English and Chinese) documents from a mixture of different sources, including webpages, Wikipedia, books, code, and research papers", but does not go into more detail.
