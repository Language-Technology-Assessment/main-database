# availability:
datasources_basemodel:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Based on Llama2, which means pretraining data is nowhere disclosed or documented, and described only in the vaguest terms in a corporate preprint released by Meta

datasources_endmodel:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback
    notes: UltraFeedback dataset made available along with model release

    notes: Download only after requesting access; requires signing a consent form

weights_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/UltraLM-13b-v2.0
    notes: Online materials appear to be in flux and several HuggingFace links generate 404 errors, hence partial

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/UltraLM-13b
    notes: Model card on HuggingFace available for 13b (Llama1) model, but not for newer releases, hence partial

datasheet:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback
    notes: Datasheet available for RLHF portion, but not for Llama2-based pretraining data, hence partial
