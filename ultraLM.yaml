# availability:
datasources_basemodel:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Based on Llama2, which means pretraining data is nowhere disclosed or documented, and described only in the vaguest terms in a corporate preprint released by Meta

datasources_endmodel:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback
    notes: UltraFeedback dataset made available along with model release

weights_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/UltraLM-13b-v2.0
    notes: Online materials appear to be in flux and several HuggingFace links generate 404 errors, hence partial
