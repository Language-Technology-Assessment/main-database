    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/scaling
    notes: "Aleph Alpha claims Pharia has been trained using the Scaling code base, which it made available as a repository mirrored from an unknown source; no specific repository found documenting the training or instruction-tuning of Pharia."

# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: 
    notes: "No specific code for training and tuning found, so no documentation of code found. Scaling code base is reasonably documented."

hardware_architecture:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/Aleph-Alpha/Pharia-1-LLM-7B-control#resource-usage
    notes: Training process, architecture and resource usage are documented at above-average levels of detail.

modelcard:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/Aleph-Alpha/Pharia-1-LLM-7B-control
    notes: Modelcard on HF provides a fair bit of documentation of training data, architecture, evaluation, and risks and limitations.
