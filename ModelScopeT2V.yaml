datasources_basemodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402
    notes: Originally trained on LAION-5B, which is ostensibly open. In general the language used is not very clear, however.

datasources_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06571
    notes: Trained on LAION-5B, WebVid, and MSR-VTT. Unclear what data was used to train V1.5.
