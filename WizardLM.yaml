# availability:
datasources_basemodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/opening-up-chatgpt/opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/blob/main/projects/llama-2-chat.yaml
    notes: Based on LLaMA, which is claimed to be public but nowhere exactly documented.

datasources_endmodel:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardLM#training-data
    notes: The Evol-Instruct dataset contains 70k instruction-following sequences generated from Evol-Instruct

weights_basemodel:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Based on LLaMA weights, which are not openly available though a leaked versions is in wide circulation.
    
weights_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-7B-V1.0/tree/main
    notes: Model weights offered as a delta to LLaMA

trainingcode:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardLM
    notes: Reasonably useful source code repository but as this is based on Llama, the underlying source is not available.

# documentation:
code:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardLM
    notes: Code is comprehensively documented and contains demos.

hardware_architecture:
    class: parial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244
    notes: Architecture described in preprint and partly accessible in code repository

preprint:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244
    notes: Preprint describes method for creating large amounts of LLM-based synthetic RLHF data and fine-tuning WizardLM based on it

paper:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No peer-reviewed paper or data audit found. Preprint mentions it is 'under review'.

modelcard:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-7B-V1.0
    notes: Model card is available, however contains links to pages talking about the model architecture, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation rather than containing them itself.

datasheet:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/WizardLM/WizardLM_evol_instruct_V2_196k
    notes: Dataset card is available, but provides no information about data collection and curation. The preprint outlines data collection (based on a 52K instruction dataset from Alpaca) and curation at a high level.
