    class: closed
    link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md#training-dataset
    notes: Based on LLaMA whose pretraining data has nowhere been disclosed or documented.

    notes: From the documentation 'The reward model used during RLHF was also trained on OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1) along with two other datasets Anthropic HH-RLHF, a dataset of preferences about AI assistant helpfulness and harmlessness; and Stanford Human Preferences Dataset a dataset of 385K collective human preferences over responses to questions/instructions in 18 different subject areas, from cooking to legal advice.'

weights_basemodel:

    notes: Based on LLaMA weights, which are not openly available though a leaked versions is in wide circulation.

weights_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta#apply-delta-weights
    notes: Model not functional out of the box as weights require a delta computation. From the docs 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'

    notes: Code is minimally documented and deployment requires non-trivial configuration, e.g. 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'
