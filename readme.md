# How to contribute 

Every system is a separate yaml file. The first few fields contain basic metadata about the system/model, the rest of the file is a set of triples of `_class`, `_link` and `_notes`. Class can be one of three values: 🟩 open, 🟧 partial or 🟥 closed (leave empty to signify NA). Link is a URL providing evidence for the openness classification. Notes provide context and reasoning for the classification.

# Which models are included?

The index aims to include any *instruct-tuned generative AI system or model* that is described by the responsible organisation or builder as "open-source" or "open", or that is marketed as such by offical outlets of the responsible organisation or builder. Generally, the index aims to:

- refer to the model by its most recent version, without naming the model size. Evaluation is then based around the largest model in the family. This may skip over some nuances with how different sizes might use different base models and fails to capture how models have evolved over time.

- the index is periodially updated by our small team (or community contributers!) to capture how models and the information supplied related to them evolve. For instance, as new models first get released and then get preprints, related 'preprint' and 'paper' entries may be updated in due course.

- models spanning across different modalities may be includes in more than one modality category (text; image; video etc) leading to multiple entries in the index.

# Openness Criteria and system information
For each model, the yaml files in this database collect (1)some general information about the system, (2) about the organization behind it, (2) and about 14 dimension of openness. The below list spells out for the openness criteria for features in the areas of system information and organisation, followed by openness criteria groupt into 'Availability', 'Documentation' and 'Access'. Use these guidelines to document determinations of openness levels as precisely as possible, including links to evidence. Notes are optional.
