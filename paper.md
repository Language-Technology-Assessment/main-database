# Summary

The European Open Source AI Index collects 
The European Open Source AI index is an EU-based community-driven public resource on open-source generative AI systems, created for the purposes of cataloguing and scrutinizing systems which claim to be open or open-source. This upload catalogues the index at a specific point in time (2025-05-12).

The index is hosted at the Centre of Language and Speech Technology at Radboud University at [osai-index.eu](osai-index.eu), and is maintained by a small team of academics and community members.

# Statement of need
Recent AI models marketed as 'open-source' have been shown to be engaged in a practice known as [open-washing](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4543807), where minimal information about a model is released (e.g. only its model weights) before claiming open-source status. This practice has most notably been seen in Meta's [Llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) models, where open-source status is claimed based on gated access to model weights and the release of a non-peer-reviewed preprint. The practice of open-source washing seeks to dilute genuine efforts towards developing truly open AI models, such as those exemplified by [BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786).

To elucidate and combat this practice, the European Open-Source AI Index evaluates 'open' models along 14 different dimensions of openness, seeking to establish to what degree these models match up to the ideal of open-source. The index is based largely off the papers [Opening up ChatGPT: Tracking openness, transparency, and accountability in instruction-tuned text generators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3571884.3604316) and [Rethinking open source generative AI: open-washing and the EU AI Act](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3630106.3659005).
