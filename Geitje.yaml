    notes: Mistral provides no documentation of any of its pretraining data. Geitje Ultra 7B is based on Geitje 7B, which does disclose that Dutch pretraining data includes Gigacorpus and MADLAD.

    notes: Mistral has limited source code available. No training code for Geitje found apart from the recipe used with the alignment handbook.

# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference/tree/main/src/mistral_inference
    notes: collection of code on github repository, although not very clearly documented and commented.

    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/BramVanroy/GEITje-7B-ultra
    notes: Some information on architecture provided in github repo and HF model card. Training was done using alignment handbook.

preprint:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12852v1
    notes: Preprint documents Dutch language resources but architecture and scientific documentation otherwise lacking due to Mistral base

modelcard:

    notes: Modelcard on HF provides information on fine-tuning but nothing for the Mistral base LLM 

datasheet:

    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BramVanroy/ultra_feedback_dutch
    notes: Datasheet available for DPO and for the Dutch portions of pretraining data, but not for original Mistral pretraining data, hence partial.
